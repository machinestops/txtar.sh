# txtar.sh

`txtar.sh` is a POSIX shell implementation of the txtar format, described at https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/txtar.

Within the file `txtar`, there are two self contained functions: `pack()` and `unpack()`. These can be added to a shell program in order to create and extract txtar files.

# Installation
Copy and paste the code of functions `pack()` or `unpack()` into your shell program, or add the `txtar` executable to your `$PATH`.
